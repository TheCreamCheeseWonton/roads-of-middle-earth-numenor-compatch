 decision_restore_numenorean_trade_routes_desc:0 "Ever since the [akallabeth|E], and the shattering of the Númenórean colonial empire, the great seaway shipping routes of Númenor have been no more. Once tens of thousands of ships hauling goods from Eriador, Haradwaith, and as far away as Thâni-Hazâd entered the ports of Númenor, enriching its people and its glory. Now, however, no ships from beyond the Isle sail to its ports, no great amounts of goods are brought to Númenor, and no riches from beyond the sea. However, if the old Númenórean colonial empire were to be re-established, the goods and people of Middle Earth would once again flow to the Isle, and bring back the glory and riches of Númenor in its prime."
